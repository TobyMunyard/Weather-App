# Weather-App
A small weather app project to help get myself familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS again as well as learning to use APIs.
Features chaning background images based on search terms, solid scaling based on device size permitted it is a laptop, desktop etc.
Integrates the https://openweathermap.org/ free API.
