# Weather-App

### What is this?
A small weather app project to help get myself familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS again as well as learning to use APIs.
Features chaning background images based on search terms, solid scaling based on device size permitted it is a laptop, desktop etc.
Integrates the https://openweathermap.org/ free API.

 ### Why make this project?
I wanted to give myself a refresher on JavaScript, HTML and CSS before taking it on in a university context. I was also curious about how APIs worked and how they are integrated into websites. This project gave me the opportunity to combine both these goals while also improving my UI design skills.

### How to build the project
I use the live server extension for VSCode to host the website temporarily, this is what I would reccomend. It can be downloaded from the extensions section in VSCode.

### Where could I improve?
* Paint Bucket: Learning more about CSS content. Even after completing this project I still feel I have many gaps in my knowledge in terms of the different controls CSS offers.
